 example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.

       If 'i' is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix will be interpreted as a unit prefix
       for binary multiples, which are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B'
       to the SI unit prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example: 'KB', 'MiB', 'G'
       and 'B' as number suffixes.

       Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the corresponding value to true.
       They can be set to false by prefixing the option name with "no". For example using "-nofoo" will
       set the boolean option with name "foo" to false.

   Stream specifiers
       Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers are used to
       precisely specify which stream(s) a given option belongs to.

       A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and separated from it by a
       colon. E.g. "-codec:a:1 ac3" contains the "a:1" stream specifier, which matches the second audio
       stream. Therefore, it would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

       A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all of them. E.g.
       the stream specifier in "-b:a 128k" matches all audio streams.

       An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, "-codec copy" or "-codec: copy" would
       copy all the streams without reencoding.

       Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

       stream_index
	   Matches the stream with this index. E.g. "-threads:1 4" would set the thread count for the
	   second stream to 4. If stream_index is used as an additional stream specifier (see below),
	   then it selects stream number stream_index from the matching streams. Stream numbering is
	   based on the order of the streams as detected by libavformat except when a program ID is also
	   specified. In this case it is based on the ordering of the streams in the program.

       stream_type[:additional_stream_specifier]
	   stream_type is one of following: 'v' or 'V' for video, 'a' for audio, 's' for subtitle, 'd'
	   for data, and 't' for attachments. 'v' matches all video streams, 'V' only matches video
	   streams which are not attached pictures, video thumbnails or cover arts. If
	   additional_stream_specifier is used, then it matches streams which both have this type and
	   match the additional_stream_specifier. Otherwise, it matches all streams of the specified
	   type.

       p:program_id[:additional_stream_specifier]
	   Matches streams which are in the program with the id program_id. If
	   additional_stream_specifier is used, then it matches streams which both are part of the
	   program and match the additional_stream_specifier.

       #stream_id or i:stream_id
	   Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS container).

       m:key[:value]
	   Matches streams with the metadata tag key having the specified value. If value is not given,
	   matches streams that contain the given tag with any value.

       u   Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must be defined and the essential
	   information such as video dimension or audio sample rate must be present.

	   Note that in ffmpeg, matching by metadata will only work properly for input files.

   Generic options
       These options are shared amongst the ff* tools.

       -L  Show license.

       -h, -?, -help, --help [arg]
	   Show help. An optional parameter may be specified to print help about a specific item. If no
	   argument is specified, only basic (non advanced) tool options are shown.

	   Possible values of arg are:

	   long
	       Print advanced tool options in addition to the basic tool options.

	   full
	       Print complete list of options, including shared and private options for encoders,
	       decoders, demuxers, muxers, filters, etc.

	   decoder=decoder_name
	       Print detailed information about the decoder named decoder_name. Use the -decoders option
	       to get a list of all decoders.

	   encoder=encoder_name
	       Print detailed information about the encoder named encoder_name. Use the -encoders option
	       to get a list of all encoders.

	   demuxer=demuxer_name
	       Print detailed information about the demuxer named demuxer_name. Use the -formats option
	       to get a list of all demuxers and muxers.

	   muxer=muxer_name
	       Print detailed information about the muxer named muxer_name. Use the -formats option to
	       get a list of all muxers and demuxers.
