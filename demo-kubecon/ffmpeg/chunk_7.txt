 a shortcut for the video_size private option, recognized by some
	   demuxers for which the frame size is either not stored in the file or is configurable -- e.g.
	   raw video or video grabbers.

	   As an output option, this inserts the "scale" video filter to the end of the corresponding
	   filtergraph. Please use the "scale" filter directly to insert it at the beginning or some
	   other place.

	   The format is wxh (default - same as source).

       -aspect[:stream_specifier] aspect (output,per-stream)
	   Set the video display aspect ratio specified by aspect.

	   aspect can be a floating point number string, or a string of the form num:den, where num and
	   den are the numerator and denominator of the aspect ratio. For example "4:3", "16:9",
	   "1.3333", and "1.7777" are valid argument values.

	   If used together with -vcodec copy, it will affect the aspect ratio stored at container level,
	   but not the aspect ratio stored in encoded frames, if it exists.

       -vn (input/output)
	   As an input option, blocks all video streams of a file from being filtered or being
	   automatically selected or mapped for any output. See "-discard" option to disable streams
	   individually.

	   As an output option, disables video recording i.e. automatic selection or mapping of any video
	   stream. For full manual control see the "-map" option.

       -vcodec codec (output)
	   Set the video codec. This is an alias for "-codec:v".

       -pass[:stream_specifier] n (output,per-stream)
	   Select the pass number (1 or 2). It is used to do two-pass video encoding. The statistics of
	   the video are recorded in the first pass into a log file (see also the option -passlogfile),
	   and in the second pass that log file is used to generate the video at the exact requested
	   bitrate.  On pass 1, you may just deactivate audio and set output to null, examples for
	   Windows and Unix:

		   ffmpeg -i foo.mov -c:v libxvid -pass 1 -an -f rawvideo -y NUL
		   ffmpeg -i foo.mov -c:v libxvid -pass 1 -an -f rawvideo -y /dev/null

       -passlogfile[:stream_specifier] prefix (output,per-stream)
	   Set two-pass log file name prefix to prefix, the default file name prefix is ``ffmpeg2pass''.
	   The complete file name will be PREFIX-N.log, where N is a number specific to the output stream

       -vf filtergraph (output)
	   Create the filtergraph specified by filtergraph and use it to filter the stream.

	   This is an alias for "-filter:v", see the -filter option.

NAME
       ffmpeg - ffmpeg video converter

SYNOPSIS
       ffmpeg [global_options] {[input_file_options] -i input_url} ... 
       {[output_file_options] output_url} ...

DESCRIPTION
       ffmpeg is a very fast video and audio converter that can also 
       grab from a live audio/video source. It can also convert between 
       arbitrary sample rates and resize video on the fly with a high 
       quality polyphase filter.

       ffmpeg reads from an arbitrary number of input "files" (which 
       can be regular files, pipes, network streams, grabbing devices, 
       etc.), specified by the "-i" option, and writes to an arbitrary 
       number of output "files", which are specified by a plain output
       url. Anything found on the command line which cannot be inter-
       preted as an option is considered to be an output url.

       Each input or output url can, in principle, contain any number of 
       streams of different types (video/audio/subtitle/attachment/data). 
       The allowed number and/or types of streams may be limited by the 
       container format. Selecting which streams from which inputs will 
       go into which output is either done automatically or with the 
       "-map" option (see the Stream selection chapter).

       To refer to input files in options, you must use their indices 
       (0-based). E.g.  the first input file is 0, the second is 1, etc. 
       Similarly, streams within a file are referred to by their indices. 
       E.g. "2:3" refers to the fourth stream in the third input file. 
       Also see the Stream specifiers chapter.

       As a general rule, options are applied to the next specified file. 
       Therefore, order is important, and you can have the same option on 
       the command line multiple times. Each occurrence is then applied 
       to the next input or output file.  Exceptions from this rule are 
       the global options (e.g. verbosity level), which should be specified 
       first.

       Do not mix input and output files -- first specify all input files, 
       then all output files. Also do not mix options which belong to 
       different files. All options apply ONLY to the next input or output 
       file and are reset between files.

       •   To set the video bitrate of the output file to 64 kbit/s:

		   ffmpeg -i input.avi -b:v 64k -bufsize 64k output.avi

       •   To force the frame rate of the output file to 24 fps:

		   ffmpeg -i input.avi -r 24 output.avi

       •   To force the frame rate of the input file (valid for raw formats only) to 1 fps and the frame
	   rate of the output file to 24 fps:

		   ffmpeg -r 1 -i input.m2v -r 24 output.avi

       The format option may be needed for raw input files.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       The transcoding process in ffmpeg for each output can be described by the following diagram:
