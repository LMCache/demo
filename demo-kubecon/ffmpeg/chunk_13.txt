 position will be decoded and discarded. When doing stream
	   copy or when -noaccurate_seek is used, it will be preserved.

	   When used as an output option (before an output url), decodes but discards input until the
	   timestamps reach position.

	   position must be a time duration specification, see the Time duration section in the
	   ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.

       -sseof position (input)
	   Like the "-ss" option but relative to the "end of file". That is negative values are earlier
	   in the file, 0 is at EOF.

       -itsoffset offset (input)
	   Set the input time offset.

	   offset must be a time duration specification, see the Time duration section in the
	   ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.

	   The offset is added to the timestamps of the input files. Specifying a positive offset means
	   that the corresponding streams are delayed by the time duration specified in offset.

       -itsscale scale (input,per-stream)
	   Rescale input timestamps. scale should be a floating point number.

       -timestamp date (output)
	   Set the recording timestamp in the container.

	   date must be a date specification, see the Date section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual.

       -metadata[:metadata_specifier] key=value (output,per-metadata)
	   Set a metadata key/value pair.

	   An optional metadata_specifier may be given to set metadata on streams, chapters or programs.
	   See "-map_metadata" documentation for details.

	   This option overrides metadata set with "-map_metadata". It is also possible to delete
	   metadata by using an empty value.

	   For example, for setting the title in the output file:

		   ffmpeg -i in.avi -metadata title="my title" out.flv

	   To set the language of the first audio stream:

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -metadata:s:a:0 language=eng OUTPUT

       -disposition[:stream_specifier] value (output,per-stream)
	   Sets the disposition for a stream.

	   This option overrides the disposition copied from the input stream. It is also possible to
	   delete the disposition by setting it to 0.

	   The following dispositions are recognized:

	   default
	   dub
	   original
	   comment
	   lyrics
	   karaoke
	   forced
	   hearing_impaired
	   visual_impaired
	   clean_effects
	   attached_pic
	   captions
	   descriptions
	   dependent
	   metadata

	   For example, to make the second audio stream the default stream:

		   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -c copy -disposition:a:1 default out.mkv

	   To make the second subtitle stream the default stream and remove the default disposition from
	   the first subtitle stream:

		   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -c copy -disposition:s:0 0 -disposition:s:1 default out.mkv

	   To add an embedded cover/thumbnail:

		   ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -i IMAGE -map 0 -map 1 -c copy -c:v:1 png -disposition:v:1 attached_pic out.mp4

	   Not all muxers support embedded thumbnails, and those who do, only support a few formats, like
	   JPEG or PNG.

       -program [title=title:][program_num=program_num:]st=stream[:st=stream...] (output)
	   Creates a program with the specified title, program_num and adds the specified stream(s) to
	   it.

       -target type (output)
	   Specify target file type ("vcd", "svcd", "dvd", "dv", "dv50"). type may be prefixed with
	   "pal-", "ntsc-" or "film-" to use the corresponding standard. All the format options (bitrate,
	   codecs, buffer sizes) are then set automatically. You can just type:

		   ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd /tmp/vcd.mpg

	   Nevertheless you can specify additional options as long as you know they do not conflict with
	   the standard, as in:

		   ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd -bf 2 /tmp/vcd.mpg

       -dn (input/output)
	   As an input option, blocks all data streams of a file from being filtered or being
	   automatically selected or mapped for any output. See "-discard" option to disable streams
	   individually.

	   As an output option, disables data recording i.e. automatic selection or mapping of any data
	   stream. For full manual control see the "-map" option.

       -dframes number (output)
	   Set the number of data frames to output. This is an obsolete alias for "-frames:d", which you
	   should use instead.

       -frames[:stream_specifier] framecount (output,per-stream)
	   Stop writing to the stream after framecount frames.

       -q[:stream_specifier] q (output,per-stream)
       -qscale[:stream_specifier] q (output,per-stream)
	   Use fixed quality scale (VBR). The meaning of q/qscale is codec-dependent.  If qscale is used
	   without a stream_specifier then it applies only to the video stream, this is to maintain
	   compatibility with previous behavior and as specifying the same codec specific value to 2
	   different codecs that is audio and video generally is not what is intended when no
	   stream_specifier is used.

       -filter[:stream_specifier] filtergraph (output,per-stream)
	   Create the filtergraph specified by filtergraph and use it to filter the stream.

	   filtergraph is a description of the filtergraph to apply to the stream, and must have a single
	   input and a single output of the same type of the stream. In the filtergraph, the input is
	   associated to the label "in", and the output to the label "out". See the ffmpeg-filters manual
	   for more information about the filtergraph syntax.

	   See the -filter_complex option if you want to create filtergraphs with multiple inputs and/or
	   outputs.

       -filter_script[:stream_specifier] filename (output,per-stream)
	   This option is similar to -filter, the only difference is that its argument is the name of the
	   file from which a filtergraph description is to be read.

       -filter_threads nb_threads (global)
	   Defines how many threads are used to process a filter pipeline. Each pipeline will produce a
	   thread pool with this many threads available for parallel processing.  The default is the
	   number of available CPUs.

       -pre[:stream_specifier] preset_name (output,per-stream)
	   Specify the preset for matching stream(s).

       -stats (global)
	   Print encoding progress/statistics. It is on by default, to explicitly disable it you need to
	   specify "-nostats".

       -progress url (global)
	   Send program-friendly progress information to url.

	   Progress information is written approximately every second and at the end of the encoding
	   process. It is made of "key=value" lines. key consists of only alphanumeric characters. The
	   last key of a sequence of progress information is always "progress".

       -stdin
	   Enable interaction on standard input. On by default unless standard input is used as an input
