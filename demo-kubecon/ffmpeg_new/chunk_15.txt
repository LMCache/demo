.
	   To explicitly disable interaction you need to specify "-nostdin".

	   Disabling interaction on standard input is useful, for example, if ffmpeg is in the background
	   process group. Roughly the same result can be achieved with "ffmpeg ... < /dev/null" but it
	   requires a shell.

       -debug_ts (global)
	   Print timestamp information. It is off by default. This option is mostly useful for testing
	   and debugging purposes, and the output format may change from one version to another, so it
	   should not be employed by portable scripts.

	   See also the option "-fdebug ts".

       -attach filename (output)
	   Add an attachment to the output file. This is supported by a few formats like Matroska for
	   e.g. fonts used in rendering subtitles. Attachments are implemented as a specific type of
	   stream, so this option will add a new stream to the file. It is then possible to use per-
	   stream options on this stream in the usual way. Attachment streams created with this option
	   will be created after all the other streams (i.e. those created with "-map" or automatic
	   mappings).

	   Note that for Matroska you also have to set the mimetype metadata tag:

		   ffmpeg -i INPUT -attach DejaVuSans.ttf -metadata:s:2 mimetype=application/x-truetype-font out.mkv

	   (assuming that the attachment stream will be third in the output file).

       -dump_attachment[:stream_specifier] filename (input,per-stream)
	   Extract the matching attachment stream into a file named filename. If filename is empty, then
	   the value of the "filename" metadata tag will be used.

	   E.g. to extract the first attachment to a file named 'out.ttf':

		   ffmpeg -dump_attachment:t:0 out.ttf -i INPUT

	   To extract all attachments to files determined by the "filename" tag:

		   ffmpeg -dump_attachment:t "" -i INPUT

	   Technical note -- attachments are implemented as codec extradata, so this option can actually
	   be used to extract extradata from any stream, not just attachments.

       -noautorotate
	   Disable automatically rotating video based on file metadata.

   Video Options
       -vframes number (output)
	   Set the number of video frames to output. This is an obsolete alias for "-frames:v", which you
	   should use instead.

       -r[:stream_specifier] fps (input/output,per-stream)
	   Set frame rate (Hz value, fraction or abbreviation).

	   As an input option, ignore any timestamps stored in the file and instead generate timestamps
	   assuming constant frame rate fps.  This is not the same as the -framerate option used for some
	   input formats like image2 or v4l2 (it used to be the same in older versions of FFmpeg).  If in
	   doubt use -framerate instead of the input option -r.

	   As an output option, duplicate or drop input frames to achieve constant output frame rate fps.

       -s[:stream_specifier] size (input/output,per-stream)
	   Set frame size.

	   As an input option, this is a shortcut for the video_size private option, recognized by some
	   demuxers for which the frame size is either not stored in the file or is configurable -- e.g.
	   raw video or video grabbers.

	   As an output option, this inserts the "scale" video filter to the end of the corresponding
	   filtergraph. Please use the "scale" filter directly to insert it at the beginning or some
	   other place.

	   The format is wxh (default - same as source).

       -aspect[:stream_specifier] aspect (output,per-stream)
	   Set the video display aspect ratio specified by aspect.

	   aspect can be a floating point number string, or a string of the form num:den, where num and
	   den are the numerator and denominator of the aspect ratio. For example "4:3", "16:9",
	   "1.3333", and "1.7777" are valid argument values.

	   If used together with -vcodec copy, it will affect the aspect ratio stored at container level,
	   but not the aspect ratio stored in encoded frames, if it exists.
